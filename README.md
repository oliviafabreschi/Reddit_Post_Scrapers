Developed in order to analyse posts on Reddit. In particular from e.g. /r/Scams, to identify the most prevalent scams posted about on Reddit. 
Also used to search for key words within these scams. Ability to extract the list to a CSV to get a list in Excel. 

The plan is potentially to develop this into a sentiment/category analysis regarding the types of scams posted about on reddit.
